## Future Improvements

### Enhanced Training Dataset

To further improve model performance, we should expand the training dataset with:

1. **Domain-Specific Training Sets**:
   - Create specialized datasets for each security domain
   - Include rare and emerging vulnerability types
   - Add examples with varying reporting styles

2. **Cross-Domain Examples**:
   - Add examples that span multiple security domains
   - Include complex scenarios with multiple vulnerability types
   - Create examples with interaction between different systems

3. **Real-World Validation**:
   - Incorporate feedback from security professionals
   - Include examples from recent CVEs and vulnerability disclosures
   - Create examples based on real penetration testing reports

### Advanced Benchmarking

1. **Human Evaluation Integration**:
   - Add support for expert review of model outputs
   - Create scoring system for human evaluators
   - Implement feedback loop for continuous improvement

2. **Advanced Metrics**:
   - Implement BLEU/ROUGE scores for response quality
   - Add metrics for actionability of remediation steps
   - Create benchmarks for different target audiences

### Model Architecture Improvements

1. **Fine-Tuning Optimization**:
   - Experiment with different hyperparameters
   - Test performance with different base models
   - Implement cross-validation for parameter selection

2. **Specialized Model Variants**:
   - Create models for different levels of technical detail
   - Develop models for specific industries (healthcare, finance, etc.)
   - Build models optimized for remediation generation

### Implementation Process

1. Enhance `/Users/mac/VulnAI/utils/expand_training_data.py` with more sophisticated templates
2. Improve domain detection with ML-based classification
3. Create a federated fine-tuning approach for specialized domains
4. Implement A/B testing framework for model comparison

## Resources Required

- Extended dataset of domain-specific vulnerabilities (200+ examples per domain)
- Human evaluators with security expertise
- Compute resources for parallel fine-tuning jobs
- Storage for larger model versions and benchmarking results
