The initial step involved using default credentials ('tomcat' and 's3cret') to access the Manager App, which allows for the upload of a WAR file. An authenticated RCE was achieved using the Metasploit module `multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload`, leading to immediate system access. The author found both flags needed for submission in a directory on the Administrator's desktop. The overall difficulty of the box is rated as \"Piece of cake,\" making it an accessible challenge for beginners."}]}

This vulnerability allows attackers to craft malicious requests that execute unintended actions on behalf of authenticated users when they visit a compromised website. The vulnerability exists because the application doesn't implement proper anti-CSRF tokens to validate the origin of requests."}]}
